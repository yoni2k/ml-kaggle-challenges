### 1. Using best classifiers:
`train: 0.831, test: 0.824, best classifier cross: 0.799 (+-0.067=0.732), min (test/cross): 0.799, best classifier:`
	
### 2. Taking Random Forest without weights:
`Stats: Best classifiers + Voting train: 0.852, test: 0.828, best classifier cross: 0.807 (+-0.07=0.737), min (test/cross): 0.807, best classifier:`
Conclusion: Doesn't seem to make much of a difference, but slightly better
